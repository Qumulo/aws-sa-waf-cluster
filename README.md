# aws-sa-waf-cluster
AWS CloudFormation templates to deploy a Qumulo cluster with one to 20 instances per the AWS Well Architected Framework.
Supports usable capacities from 1TB to 6PB with all Qumulo Core features.

## Requirements

These templates deploy Qumulo AMIs with [Qumulo Core Cloud Software](https://qumulo.com/product/cloud-products/) version `>= 4.0.6`

A subscription to an [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?x=0&y=0&searchTerms=qumulo) offer is required.
For private offers via the AWS Marketplace contact [Qumulo Sales](http://discover.qumulo.com/cloud-calc-contact.html).

## Usage

**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to a release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/vx.y`).

For architectural details, resource requirements, deployment instructions, and configuration options see the [deployment guide](./docs/aws-sa-waf-cluster.pdf).
